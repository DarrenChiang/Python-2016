Class 1:
We learn the benefits of GIT before going into the basic commands for managing files.

"git init" - creates repository
"git status" - checks status of file in directory
"git add" - readies file for committing
"git commit" - commits the readied files
"git push" - update remote repository
"git pull" - update from remote repository

Class 2:
We practice the commands. This also includes git rm, which removes files.

Class 3:
We go over paradigms, the difference between declarative and imperative programming, and actually learn a few commands in Python.

Class 4:
We write two programs: one to find the surface areas and volumes of several figures and the other to find the solution to the quadratic equation. 
This serves as practice.

Class 5:
Python can also be written from notepads. Just typing the code and running the command "python filename" is enough to get it started. 
We learn about the if statements and comparison signs.

Class 6:
The comparison statements can also use "and", "or", and "not" directly. We learn about importing files (only those within directories of python).


import "something"
import "something" as "nickname"
from "something" import "something_specific"

Class 9:
The class practiced an algorithm to generate prime numbers to the point where the user specifies. For loops were learned in order to complete the
alorithm, and for loops only work with lists (arrays).

We go over lists and some functions, utilities and properties of them. Unlike Java or C++, lists in Python have functions that increase their size. Lists
also can hold multiple values per element.

10/6/2016
We practice with functions using list arguments. The map function puts every element in the array (second argument) through a function (first argument).
The filter function does the same but for functions returning booleans.

10/10/2016
Focus on functions:
- must be simple
- must be well defined
for the sake of usability.

10/12/2016
List comprehension: declaration of an array that requires loops and conditions in one single line.
[value for range if condition]

Simple functions => complex program

10/24/2016
Dictionaries: a lot like objects in Java
- has own variables
- no order
- uses {}
- del, clear, copy, fromkeys, get, items, keys, values

10/26/2016
We do some "stackoverflow" questions.

10/28/2016
We do more.
os.listdir("directory") returns a list of all files in a directory. We also draw a circle with pyplot using the circle equation.
We solve lots of questions.

We work on Tic Tac Toe, using dictionaries to organize the grid.
