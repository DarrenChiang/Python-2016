Class 1:
We learn the benefits of GIT before going into the basic commands for managing files.

"git init" - creates repository
"git status" - checks status of file in directory
"git add" - readies file for committing
"git commit" - commits the readied files
"git pull" -

Class 2:
We practice the commands. This also includes rm, which removes files.

Class 3:
We go over paradigms, the difference between declarative and imperative programming, and actually learn a few commands in Python.

Class 4:
We write two programs: one to find the surface areas and volumes of several figures and the other to find the solution to the quadratic equation. This serves as practice.
